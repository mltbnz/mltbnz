### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating a mobile client for [weg.li](https://weg.li) with [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) and `SwiftUI`. Maintainer of [Critical Maps iOS](https://github.com/criticalmaps/criticalmaps-ios). 
 - 🌱 I’m currently learning **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile** for sharing components between Android and iOS and also **Jetpack Compose** (Desktop) since at [Wonderz](https://github.com/WonderzGmbH) we decided to build a desktop app with it. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with learning creative coding and to operate and improve my pen plotter skills.
